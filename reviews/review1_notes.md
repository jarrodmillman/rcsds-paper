# Responses to reviewer 1

Reviewer 1's primary desire is that we align our paper better with research on
what is effective in education, including "project-based learning".

They cited this NSF report: [Common Guidelines for Education Research and
Development](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13126/nsf13126.pdf).

From that document, our paper fits best in their category "Early stage or
exploratory research".  Quoting from page 12 of that doc:

> The purpose of Early-Stage or Exploratory Research is to investigate
> approaches to education problems to establish the basis for design and
> development of new interventions or strategies, and/or to provide evidence
> for whether an established intervention or strategy is ready to be tested in
> an efficacy study.
>
> Early-Stage or Exploratory Research should establish initial connections to
> outcomes of interest. Studies in this genre should support the development
> of a well-explicated theory of action that can inform the development,
> modification, or evaluation of an intervention or strategy. They should
> build on existing research and theory to examine issues such as: (1)
> Associations between (a) education or learning outcomes and (b) malleable
> factors (that is, factors that are alterable, such as childrenâ€™s behaviors;
> technologies; education programs, policies, and practices) and; (2) Factors
> and conditions that may mediate or moderate the relationship between (a)
> education or learning outcomes and (b) malleable factors; and (3)
> Opportunities for new interventions or strategies, and challenges to their
> adoption, with the goal of informing policy, practice, and future design or
> development.

As a partial response, we could do a couple of things:

1.   Make it clearer in the introduction that we are doing a feasibility study
     or "spike" in terms of software development.  We beleived that we could
     teach both the tools and the content in one course, but we knew that many
     people would not believe this, so we intended to show that our belief was
     correct.
1.   We could say a bit more about why it worked.  Maybe we could emphasize
     more that we did not intend for the students to learn the tools or
     analysis by doing the project, but to practice what they had learned in
     class; the open project development on Github made the process more
     visible and explicit; marking made students justify their contribution
     with evidence, making "loafing" less likely ([Lee & Lim
     2012](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.298.7245&rep=rep1&type=pdf));
     expert support from subject experts, who also used the tools.
