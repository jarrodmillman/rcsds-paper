# Responses to reviewer 1

Reviewer 1's primary desire is that we align our paper better with research on
what is effective in education, including "project-based learning".

They cited this NSF report: [Common Guidelines for Education Research and
Development](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13126/nsf13126.pdf).

From that document, our paper fits best in their category "Early stage or
exploratory research".  Quoting from page 12 of that doc:

> The purpose of Early-Stage or Exploratory Research is to investigate
> approaches to education problems to establish the basis for design and
> development of new interventions or strategies, and/or to provide evidence
> for whether an established intervention or strategy is ready to be tested in
> an efficacy study.
>
> Early-Stage or Exploratory Research should establish initial connections to
> outcomes of interest. Studies in this genre should support the development
> of a well-explicated theory of action that can inform the development,
> modification, or evaluation of an intervention or strategy. They should
> build on existing research and theory to examine issues such as: (1)
> Associations between (a) education or learning outcomes and (b) malleable
> factors (that is, factors that are alterable, such as children’s behaviors;
> technologies; education programs, policies, and practices) and; (2) Factors
> and conditions that may mediate or moderate the relationship between (a)
> education or learning outcomes and (b) malleable factors; and (3)
> Opportunities for new interventions or strategies, and challenges to their
> adoption, with the goal of informing policy, practice, and future design or
> development.

Later in the same document there is a table for "Guidelines for Evidence to Be
Produced by Studies".  This has:

> The project’s outcomes should include
>
> (1) Empirical evidence regarding (a) the malleable factors’ association with
> education or learning outcomes and/or (b) evidence on whether the factors and
> conditions moderate and/or mediate the relations between the malleable
> factors and the learner outcomes;
> (2) (a) A well-specified conceptual framework that supports a theoretical
> explanation for the link between the malleable factors and the education or
> learning outcomes and/or (b) a theoretical explanation for the factors’ and
> conditions’ moderation and/or mediation of the relationship between the
> malleable factors and learner outcomes; and
> (3) A determination based on the empirical evidence and conceptual framework
> of whether there is a basis for pursuing a Design and Development project or
> an Efficacy study or whether further Foundational or Early-Stage or
> Exploratory Research is needed before proceeding to efficacy or effectiveness
> testing.

As a partial response, we could:

1.   Make it clearer in the introduction that we are doing a feasibility study
     or "spike" in terms of software development.  We beleived that we could
     teach both the tools and the content in one course, but we knew that many
     people would not believe this, so we intended to show that our belief was
     correct.
1.   We could say a bit more about why it worked.  Maybe we could emphasize
     more that we did not intend for the students to learn the tools or
     analysis by doing the project, but to practice what they had learned in
     class; the open project development on Github made the process more
     visible and explicit; marking made students justify their contribution
     with evidence, making "loafing" less likely ([Lee & Lim
     2012](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.298.7245&rep=rep1&type=pdf));
     expert support from subject experts, who also used the tools.

I'm not sure what do about the "project outcomes" above.  I think our course
was more radical in intent than the kind of studies the NSF was thinking of; we
weren't trying a modification to an existing course to improve, for example,
student motivation, we were trying to teach something similar to a whole new
subject.  Our question was - can we teach it?  If the reader believes our
assessment of the student projects, then the answer is yes.  To follow up, we
can propose changes that someone might like to make, in order to make the
course more effective.

Put otherwise, the NSF appears to be thinking of the situation where the
curriculum is more or less set, and the study is looking for more effective
ways to teach that curriculum.  We're proposing a big change in the curriculum.
