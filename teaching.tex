\section*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank the students who took our class for their enthusiasm,
hard work, and thoughtful feedback.  Russ Poldrack and the team OpenfMRI.org
were the foundation that made it possible for us to design the student
projects in we did. Russ and the team were very generous in providing
processed data at short notice for the students to analyze.  Alexander Huth
gave a inspiring overview of neuroimaging analysis in a guest lecture.
St{\'e}fan van der Walt, Fernando P{\'e}rez, and Paul Ivanov have through long
collaboration and numerous discussions helped clarify and refine our approach
to teaching.  Thanks to Mark D'Esposito for his steadfast support and
encouragement as we experimented with new ways of teaching.
