We describe a project-based introduction to reproducible and collaborative
neuroimaging data analysis.
The traditional approach to teaching neuroimaging data analysis emphasizes
the big picture and attempts to introduce students to many
of the conceptual elements in image analysis.
Our approach emphasizes
(a) the computational tools that should be used daily to ensure
computationally reproducible work as well as
(b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used
for a basic analysis of a single run in an MRI scanner.

KJM was funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant
GBMF3834 and by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through Grant 2013-10-27 to the
University of California, Berkeley.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank the students who took our class for their enthusiasm,
hard work, and thoughtful feedback.  Russ Poldrack and the OpenFMRI team
were the foundation that made it possible for us to design the student
projects in we did. Russ and the team were very generous in providing
processed data at short notice for the students to analyze.  Alexander Huth
gave a inspiring overview of neuroimaging analysis in a guest lecture.
St{\'e}fan van der Walt, Fernando P{\'e}rez, and Paul Ivanov have through long
collaboration and numerous discussions helped clarify and refine our approach
to teaching.  Thanks to Mark D'Esposito for his steadfast support and
encouragement as we experimented with new ways of teaching.
