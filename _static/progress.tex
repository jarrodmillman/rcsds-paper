Progress reports and presentations
----------------------------------

1. Briefly describe data
   - Paper
   - dsnum from openfmri.org
   - What kind of data is it?

2. Briefly describe what you've done so far
   - data fetching/preprocessing
   - initial analysis
   - plots? figures?

3. What is your plan?
   - What analysis will you perform?
   - How does it relate to the original data analysis?
     - Will you use all the data?  Why or why not?
     - What model/preprocessing steps will you simplify?
   - What are the problems you face?
     - Try to be explicit about your issues?
     - Suggest potential solutions and/or approaches.
     - What do you need to research more?  Have you found sources?
     - Will you try to make "inferences" from the data?
       - How will you deal with multiple comparisons?
       - How will you attempt to validate your model?     

4. Process
   - What was the hardest part of the process so far?
     - Git workflow, Python, fMRI data, all of the above
     - Having an ill-defined assignment?
   - How successful have you been at overcoming these obstacles?
   - What issues have you faced working as a team?  How have you
     been addressing them?
   - What parts of the class have been the most useful?
   - What parts have been the least helpful or most confusing?
   - What do you need to do to successfully complete the project?
   - How difficult are you finding it to make your work reproducible?
     Do you feel confident that you are in a position to make your
     projects reproducible?
   - What would be most helpful for your team in the remaining weeks?
     Additional lectures?  Structured or unstructured group work?
   - What potential topics would be most useful for us to cover?
     - Overview of brain / neuroanatomy?
     - More linear regression (ANOVA)? PCA? The mathematics or the implementation?
     - Machine learning (classification, prediction, cross-validation)?
     - Permutation tests (and maybe bootstrap)?
     - Software tools (Git, Make, Python, statmodels, etc.)
     - Technical writing and scientific visualization?
     - Advanced topics (regularized regression, selective inference)?
